TRIGGER PHRASES (use tool immediately when you see these):
- "this page" 
- "what am I looking at"
- "summarize this"
- "what is this about"
- "explain this content"
- "is this suitable"
- "what does this say"
- "tell me about this"

The user has browser integration - you can access their current webpage without needing a URL. 
DO NOT ask for URLs or links. Just use this tool.

Example: User says "summarize this page" â†’ immediately call getWebpageContent with reason "to summarize the current webpage the user is viewing"`,
    parameters: z.object({
        reason: z.string().describe('Detailed reason why you are accessing the webpage content, including what the user asked for')
